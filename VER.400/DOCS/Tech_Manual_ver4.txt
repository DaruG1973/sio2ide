I. SIO2IDE HARDWARE

    The interface hardware is based on the Atmel ATmega323-8PC micro (2kB RAM, 32kB FLASH).
  The following control and configuration elements are available on
  the SIO2IDE PCB:

    Interface state monitor LEDs:
       PWR_LED    - indicates the interface power supply status
       SIO_LED    - indicates that the SIO command is received
       IDE_LED    - indicates the IDE bus activity (HDD output)

    Configuration jumpers:
       MODE_ZW    - Interface Mode ON - IDE2USB, OFF - SIO2IDE
       HD1_ZW     - swap disk D1: with Common disk D1:
       MS_ZW      - Master/Slave mode selection or TEST mode selection

    Connectors:
       IDE_IO     - standard 40pin IDE connector for HD (full 16bit interface)
                    44 Pin 2.5" converter available from: http://cablesnmor.com/hard-drive-converter.html

                      pin 1    - Data_In (SIO pin 5)
                      pin 2    - Data_Out (SIO pin 3)
                      pin 3    - Command (SIO pin 7)
                      pin 4    - Reset_Out
                      pin 5    - GND (SIO pin 4)
                      pin 6    - USART clock I/O (NOT Used)
                      pin 7    - +5V (SIO pin 10)
       USB_IO     - USB type B connector
                      pin 1    - +5V

                      pin 4    - GND

  The Reset_Out (SIO_IO pin 4) is active (low state) when the SIO2IDE performs
  the start-up initialisation sequence and the disk D1: is On (jumper HD1_ZW).
  Note that is MODE_ZW is ON (IDE2USB mode) the Reset_Out is active (low state).


II. DISK STRUCTURE

    The SIO2IDE interface uses disks formatted under DOS or WIN9X operating
  system. The following file systems (partition's types) are supported:

      Partition Type      ID       Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------
      Small DOS           $04      FAT16 <32MB
      Big DOS             $06      FAT16 >32MB (DOS)
      FAT16               $0E      FAT16 >32MB (Windows)
      FAT32               $0B      FAT32
      FAT32               $0C      FAT32 with LBA support
      ISO9660             $7F      CD-ROM filesystem

    ATARI disk images supported by the interface must be stored in well known
  ATR file format. There are the following limitations for the *.ATR files:

    - all ATR files must contain correct 16B header
    - all ATR files should be defragmented (use defrag.exe if needed)
      Note that not defragmented ATR files work, but access to data is slower.
    - directory with ATR files must contain configuration file (sio2ide.cfg)

  All ATR files that don't meet above criteria will not be visible by the
  SIO2IDE interface.

    The user can store ATR files in any disk location but the interface after
  power up or reset always starts from the last active directory (IDE Master drive).
  To change active configuration (directory) use fdisk.com software.

  For example your HDD can contain the following files:

    C:\
      |- sio2ide.cfg
      |- mdos453.atr
      |- soft001.atr
      |- ...
      |-------------\DOS\
      |                    |- defrag.exe
      |                    |- speedisk.exe
      |                    |- ...
      |-------------\UTILS\
      |                    |- chkfs.exe
      |                    |- makeatr.exe
      |                    |- ...
      |-------------\SOFT\
                           |- games003.atr
                           |-----------------\GAMES\
                           |                        |- sio2ide.cfg
                           |                        |- games001.atr
                           |                        |- games002.atr
                           |-----------------\UTIL\
                                                    |- sio2ide.cfg
                                                    |- util001.atr
                                                    |- util002.atr

  In the above configuration the user can select and set as active one of the
  following directories (sio2ide.cfg files):

      C:\sio2ide.cfg
      C:\SOFT\GAMES\sio2ide.cfg
      C:\SOFT\UTIL\sio2ide.cfg

  Note that file C:\SOFT\games003.atr will not be visible by the SIO2IDE.

  Each configuration file (sio2ide.cfg) is a text file that includes current
  ATARI disk assignment. Lines in this file have the following format:

  D<no>=<ATR file>

  where:
       <no>        - ATARI disk number (1-9)
                     NOTE: 9 identifies common disk D1: (use HD1_ZW)
                           Common disk can be set only in root sio2ide.cfg.
       <ATR file>  - ATR file name without extension (capital letters)

  Note that:

     - each entry must start from the first column
     - order is not important
     - unresolved lines are ignored
     - file size is limited to 512B

  For example c:\sio2ide.cfg file can contain the following data:

>>> cut here -------------------------------------------------------------------

//             SIO2IDE v 4.3 configuration file (disks map)
//
// Syntax:   D<nr>=<name>
//           nr   - ATARI disk number (1-9)
//                  Note: 9 identifies Common disk D1: (use HD1_ZW)
//           name - ATR file name (without extension)
//
// Warning:  Size of this file is limited to 512B
//
D1=MDOS453
D8=SOFT001
D5=SOFT002
D2=IMAGE002
D9=MDOS453
// End

>>> cut here -------------------------------------------------------------------

  After power up or reset the following disk will be available for ATARI
  (refer to the above disk structure):

  D1: = MDOS453.ATR
  D2:   not available because c:\image002.atr does not exist
  D3:   not assigned
  D4:   not assigned
  D5:   not available because c:\soft002.atr does not exist
  D6:   not assigned
  D7:   not assigned
  D8: = SOFT001.ATR
  D1: = MDOS453.ATR Common disk swaped with D1: by HD1_ZW jumper

  To use Common disk D1 please add entry D9:=<ATR file> to your root sio2ide.cfg file.
  This disk will be visible as D1: from all subdirectories on your HDD
  (if HD1_ZW is Off).

  Note that Long File Names (LFN) are supported by SIO2IDE.
  For FAT disks LFN files will be visible like under Windows (max 39 chars).
  Note that file names in sio2ide.cfg file must be written in DOS format
  (i.e. ATARI_~1).
  For ISO9660 disks LFN files will not be visible by SIO2IDE (Joilett is NOT supported).


III. SIO2IDE INTERFACE (via Atari SIO)

     The physical disk drives and other peripherals are external to the ATARI
  home computers and are normally attached to the "serial interface connector"
  on the right side or back of the computer. The software in the operating
  system (OS ROMs) to access the devices attached to either connector call
  the "serial I/O driver" or SIO for short. The SIO2IDE interface is capable
  of handling two groups of SIO commands:

     - Disk Drive specific commands required by the Atari OS and DOS
     - SIO2IDE specific commands that are used by the interface configuration
       software (fdisk.com)

  III.1. Disk Drive commands

     The following minimum set of disk drive commands are supported by the
  SIO2IDE interface:

   Device  Unit   Command  Direction   Byte Ct.   Aux Bytes    Function
   $31    Drive#    $21    From Drive   128/256       0         FORMAT DISK
   $31    Drive#    $50    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(no vfy)
   $31    Drive#    $52    From Drive   128/256    1 to MaxS    READ
   $31    Drive#    $53    From Drive      4          0         READ STATUS
   $31    Drive#    $57    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(verify)
   $31    Drive#    $4E    From Drive      12      1 to MaxS    READ CFG.
   $31    Drive#    $4F    To Drive        12      1 to MaxS    WRITE CFG.
   $31    Drive#    $3F    From Drive      1          0         READ HS index

  General notes:

     The byte count is always 128 for the first three sectors (1, 2, and 3)
     of a drive. All other sectors on a disk drive are 128/256 bytes long.

     Drive# identifies the drive unit (0-7). Max 8 disk drives can be
     emulated by the SIO2IDE interface.

     MaxS is a maximum sector number that is available on the emulated disk
     drive unit (1-65535).

  FORMAT DISK ($21)

     This command is accepted by the interface but the disk drive is not physically
  formatted (this operation is not needed). The SIO2IDE always returns a fixed
  data block 128/256 bytes (filed with 0xFF). This indicates that operation was
  successfully finished.

  READ STATUS ($53)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by this command are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Indicates the sector size (fixed value 0x30 or 0x10).
                  bit 4: 1 - Motor is ON
                  bit 5: 1 - 256 bytes
     byte 1:    Inverted Error Status (fixed value 0xFF, no errors)
     byte 2:    Format Time Out (fixed value 0xE0)
     byte 3:    Fixed value 0x00

  READ/WRITE CFG. ($4E,$4F)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by these commands are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Tracks per side (0x01 for HDD, one "long" track)
     byte 1:    Interface version (0x10)
     byte 2:    Sectors/Track - high byte
     byte 3:    Sectors/Track - low byte
     byte 4:    Side Code (0 - single sided)
     byte 5:    Disk Type Code (0x0C or 0x80)
                  bit 2: 1 - double density (256 bytes/sector)
                  bit 3: 1 - IDE HDD
     byte 6:    High byte of Bytes/Sector (0x01 for double density)
     byte 7:    Low byte of Bytes/Sector (0x00 for double density)
     byte 8:    Translation control (0x40)
                  bit 6: Always 1 (to indicate drive present)
     bytes 9-11 Drive interface type string "IDE"

  Note that the data transferred by the Write Configuration command is not
  used by the SIO2IDE interface. Only bytes 2 and 3 (max number of sectors)
  are verified with drive parameters.

  III.2. SIO2IDE specific commands

     The following set of SIO2IDE specific commands are supported by the
  interface:

   Device  Unit  Command  Direction  Byte Ct.  Aux Bytes  Function
   $71     S2I#    $11    From Drive   15        Disk#     GET disk desc.
   $71     S2I#    $12    To Drive     15        Disk#     PUT disk desc.
   $71     S2I#    $13    From Drive   15          -       GET first ATR file from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $14    From Drive   15          -       GET next ATR file from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $15    From Drive    1        Disk#     OFF disk (returns $FF if OK)
   $71     S2I#    $16    From Drive    1          -       SAVE config file in active dir. (returns $FF if OK)
   $71     S2I#    $17    From Drive   10          -       GET HDD params.
   $71     S2I#    $18    From Drive    4          -       GET File System params.
   $71     S2I#    $19    From Drive   15          -       GET first Subdir from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $1A    From Drive   15          -       GET next Subdir from cur. dir
   $71     S2I#    $1B    To Drive     15          -       CHANGE current directory
   $71     S2I#    $1C    From Drive   15          -       GET current directory
   $71     S2I#    $1D    From Drive   15          -       INITIALISE current directory
   $71     S2I#    $61    To Drive     4           -       Set Phisical Sector Number (32bit value)
   $71     S2I#    $62    From Drive   512         -       Get Phisical Sector from drive
   $71     S2I#    $63    To Drive     512         -       Put Phisical Sector to drive
   $71     S2I#    $64    From Drive   39          -       Get Long File Name (first use cmd $61)
   $71     S2I#    $65    To Drive     1           -       Change Current IDE Drive (0x00=Master, 0x10=Slave)

  Notes:

     S2I# identifies the SIO2IDE interface (0-1). Maximum two SIO2IDE interfaces can
     be connected to the Atari SIO Bus (jumper MS_ZW).

     Disk# identifies the ATARI disk (1-9).

     Commands $11 $12 $15 allows to read and update internal disk table serviced
     by the interface. This table holds current disks assignment.

     Commands $13 $14 allows to get descriptions of all correct ATR files that
     are available in the current directory.

     Commands $19 $1A allows to get descriptions of all subdirectories that
     are available in the current directory. To initialise current directory
     use command $1D. Note that after successfull initialisation interface
     saves current directory description to the internal EEPROM. During
     startup interface first tries to initialise last saved directory.

     Note that: Commands $13 to $16 can be used only if current directory was
     successfully initialised by command $1D.

     Commands $61 to $63 can be used for reading and writting sectorrs from/to
     drive. Note that only HD are supported and sectors are numbered as in LBA
     mode (0 to max sector). Expierenced users may use these commands for
     writting usefull HD utilities for Atari.

     NOTE: PLEASE BE CAREFULL WHEN YOU WILL USE THESE COMMANDS.

     Command $65 allows to change current IDE Drive serviced by the SIO2IDE.
     To change drive you must send one data byte to the SIO2IDE:

         $00 - Master IDE device is selected
         $10 - Slave IDE device is selected

     NOTE:
       - SIO2IDE starts always from Master IDE device (last used directory)
       - If Slave IDE device is not available or can not be initialised
         SIO2IDE reinitialises Master IDE device.
       - SIO2IDE saves last used directory for both drives
       - It is recommended to perform Warm restart of the Atari computer
         after changing IDE device.

     All disks, ATR files and directories are described by the following common
     data structure (15B long):

     Data      Bytes    Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Name       0-7     Disk/File/Directory name, 8 chars filled with spaces

     Sectors    12-13   Number of sectors (128B/256B), 0 for directories
     Flags      14      bit 7:  correct ATR file
                        bit 6:  256B sectors
                        bit 5:  file is not defragmented

                        bit 0:  directory that includes sio2ide.cfg file

     The following data structure describes IDE device parameters (10B long,
     command $17):

     Data      Bytes    Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
