I. SIO2IDE HARDWARE

    The interface hardware is based on the Atmel AT90S8515 micro (512B RAM, 8kB FLASH).
  The following control and configuration elements are available on
  the SIO2IDE PCB:

    Interface state monitor LEDs:
       PWR_LED    - indicates the interface power supply status
       SIO_LED    - indicates that the SIO command is received
       BSY_LED    - indicates that the Hard Disk is busy or error occur
       IDE_LED    - indicates the IDE bus activity (HDD output)

    Configuration jumpers:
       HD1_ZW     - On/Off disk D1: (useful e.g. during configuration)
       INIT_ZW    - force HD initialisation (DPA is initialised, see below)
       MS_ZW      - Master/Slave mode selection

    Connectors:
       IDE_IO     - standard 40pin IDE connector for HD (full 16bit interface)
                    44 Pin 2.5" converter available from: http://cablesnmor.com/hard-drive-converter.html
       ISP_IO     - Atmel micro In System Programming connector (for SW upgrade)
                      pin 1    - GND
                      pin 2    - GND
                      pin 3    - AT90S8515 Reset
                      pin 4    - AT90S8515 SS
                      pin 5    - AT90S8515 MOSI
                      pin 6    - AT90S8515 MISO
                      pin 7    - AT90S8515 SCK
                      pin 8    - Not Connected
       SIO_IO     - Atari SIO bus plus extensions
                      pin 1    - Data_In (SIO pin 5)
                      pin 2    - Data_Out (SIO pin 3)
                      pin 3    - Command (SIO pin 7)
                      pin 4    - Reset_Out
                      pin 5    - GND (SIO pin 4)
                      pin 6    - GND (SIO pin 4)
                      pin 7    - +5V (SIO pin 10)
                      pin 8    - Not Connected

  The Reset_Out (SIO_IO pin 4) is active (low state) when the SIO2IDE performs
  the start-up initialization sequence and the disk D1: is On (jumper HD1_ZW).


II. DISK STRUCTURE

     The SIO2IDE interface uses all sectors that are available on the attached
  IDE Disk Drive. The maximum sector number is calculated using the following
  formula:

                        MaxSec = Cyl * Head * SpT

  Where:
        Cyl    - number of cylinders
        Head   - number of heads
        SpT    - number of sectors per track

  All these parameters are read directly from the Disk Drive during the SIO2IDE
  start-up sequence. The interface uses standard ATA command (IDENTIFY DRIVE,
  0xEC).

  The following simple disk structure is used by the SIO2IDE interface:

              Sec#      Disk sectors map
                        -------------------------------
                0       |     Disk Parameters Area    |
                        -------------------------------
                1       |                             |
                2       |        Disk Data Area       |
                3       |                             |
                        ~~~~                       ~~~~
             MaxSec-1   |                             |
                        -------------------------------

  The Disk Parameters Area (DPA) uses only one disk sector (number 0). This
  sector contains three data blocks that describe the Disk Drive and SIO2IDE
  configuration.

    Block 0:
       byte 0-1: Disk ID (magic number used internally by the interface)
       byte 2:   SWver Software version (e.g. 0x10 = ver 1.0)
       byte 3:   MaxHDP Maximum number of partitions stored on Disk (size of
                 Partitions Table >0, in current version 48). In practice the
                 MaxHDP value is limited only by the sector #0 size.

    Block 1 (Disk Sequence Table, DST):
       byte 0:   HD Partition attached to drive D1 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 1:   HD Partition attached to drive D2 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 2:   HD Partition attached to drive D3 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 3:   HD Partition attached to drive D4 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 4:   HD Partition attached to drive D5 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 5:   HD Partition attached to drive D6 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 6:   HD Partition attached to drive D7 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 7:   HD Partition attached to drive D8 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 8:   HD Partition attached to drive D9 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 9:   HD Partition attached to drive D10 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 10:  HD Partition attached to drive D11 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 11:  HD Partition attached to drive D12 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 12:  HD Partition attached to drive D13 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 13:  HD Partition attached to drive D14 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)
       byte 14:  HD Partition attached to drive D15 (0-(MaxHDP-1) or 0xFF-none)

    Note: Initially this block is filled with values: 0 to 14.

    Block 2 (Disk Partitions Table, DPT):
       byte 0-1:             HD Partition #0 size (sectors, 0-65535)
       byte 2-3:             HD Partition #1 size (sectors, 0-65535)
       byte 4-5:             HD Partition #2 size (sectors, 0-65535)
       byte 6-7:             HD Partition #3 size (sectors, 0-65535)
       ....
       byte ((MaxHDP*2)-2)-
            ((MaxHDP*2)-1):  HD Partition #(MaxHDP-1) size (sectors, 0-65535)

  The Disk Data Area (DDA) uses all remaining disk sectors. Described disk
  structure limits available disk space to:

        MaxSize = (MaxSec - 2) * 256 [Bytes]

  Note that the current SIO2IDE version based on the AT90S8515 Atmel micro can
  handle only 256 Bytes from each disk sector (remaining bytes are not used). Future
  interfaces based on the same PCB and the ATmega161 Atmel micro will not have
  this limitation.


III. SIO2IDE INTERFACE (via Atari SIO)

     The physical disk drives and other peripherals are external to the ATARI
  home computers and are normally attached to the "serial interface connector"
  on the right side or back of the computer. The software in the operating
  system (OS ROMs) to access the devices attached to either connector call
  the "serial I/O driver" or SIO for short. The SIO2IDE interface is capable
  of handling two groups of SIO commands:

     - Disk Drive specific commands required by the Atari OS and DOS
     - SIO2IDE specific commands that are used by the interface configuration
       software (fdisk.com)

  III.1. Disk Drive commands

     The following minimum set of disk drive commands are supported by the
  SIO2IDE interface:

   Device  Unit   Command  Direction   Byte Ct.   Aux Bytes    Function
   $31    Drive#    $21    From Drive     256         0         FORMAT DISK
   $31    Drive#    $50    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(no vfy)
   $31    Drive#    $52    From Drive   128/256    1 to MaxS    READ
   $31    Drive#    $53    From Drive      4          0         READ STATUS
   $31    Drive#    $57    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(verify)
   $31    Drive#    $4E    From Drive      12      1 to MaxS    READ CFG.
   $31    Drive#    $4F    To Drive        12      1 to MaxS    WRITE CFG.

  General notes:

     The byte count is always 128 for the first three sectors (1, 2, and 3)
     of a drive. All other sectors on a disk drive are 256 bytes long.

     Drive# identifies the drive unit (0-14). Max 15 disk drives can be
     emulated by the SIO2IDE interface.

     MaxS is a maximum sector number that is available on the emulated disk
     drive unit (1-65535).

  FORMAT DISK ($21)

     This command is accepted by the interface but the disk drive is not physically
  formatted (this operation is not needed). The SIO2IDE always returns a fixed
  data block 256 bytes (filed with 0xFF). This indicates that operation was
  successfully finished.

  READ STATUS ($53)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by this command are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Indicates the sector size (fixed value 0x30).
                  bit 4: 1 - Motor is ON
                  bit 5: 1 - 256 bytes
     byte 1:    Inverted Error Status (fixed value 0xFF, no errors)
     byte 2:    Format Time Out (fixed value 0xE0)
     byte 3:    Fixed value 0x00

  READ/WRITE CFG. ($4E,$4F)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by these commands are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Tracks per side (0x01 for HDD, one "long" track)
     byte 1:    Interface version (0x10)
     byte 2:    Sectors/Track - high byte
     byte 3:    Sectors/Track - low byte
     byte 4:    Side Code (0 - single sided)
     byte 5:    Disk Type Code (0x0C)
                  bit 2: 1 - double density (256 bytes/sector)
                  bit 3: 1 - IDE HDD
     byte 6:    High byte of Bytes/Sector (0x01 for double density)
     byte 7:    Low byte of Bytes/Sector (0x00 for double density)
     byte 8:    Translation control (0x40)
                  bit 6: Always 1 (to indicate drive present)
     bytes 9-11 Drive interface type string "IDE"

  Note that the data transferred by the Write Configuration command is not
  used by the SIO2IDE interface. Only bytes 2 and 3 (max number of sectors)
  are verified with drive parameters.

  III.2. SIO2IDE specific commands

     The following set of SIO2IDE specific commands are supported by the
  interface:

   Device  Unit   Command  Direction   Byte Ct.   Aux Bytes    Function
   $71     S2I#     $EE    From Drive     13         0         GET S2I STAT
   $71     S2I#     $EC    From Drive  15+DPTsize    0         GET DST+DPT
   $71     S2I#     $ED    To Drive    15+DPTsize    0         PUT DST+DPT

  Notes:

     S2I# identifies the SIO2IDE interface (0-1). Maximum two SIO2IDE interfaces can
     be connected to the Atari SIO Bus (jumper MS_ZW).

     DPTsize = MaxHDP * 2

     The SIO2IDE Status data block contains the following data (13 bytes):
       byte 0-1:    Cyl, number of cylinders on Disk Drive
       byte 2:      Head, number of heads on Disk Drive
       byte 3-4:    SpT, number of sectors per track
       byte 5-8:    Sec, total number of sectors on Disk Drive
       byte 9-12:   DPA Block #0
