I. SIO2IDE HARDWARE

    The interface hardware is based on the Atmel ATmega161-8PC micro (1kB RAM, 16kB FLASH).
  The following control and configuration elements are available on
  the SIO2IDE PCB:

    Interface state monitor LEDs:
       PWR_LED    - indicates the interface power supply status
       SIO_LED    - indicates that the SIO command is received
       BSY_LED    - indicates that the Hard Disk is busy or error occur
       IDE_LED    - indicates the IDE bus activity (HDD output)

    Configuration jumpers:
       HD1_ZW     - On/Off disk D1: (useful e.g. during configuration)
       INIT_ZW    - Disk swap D1: <-> D2:
       MS_ZW      - Master/Slave mode selection

    Connectors:
       IDE_IO     - standard 40pin IDE connector for HD (full 16bit interface)
                    44 Pin 2.5" converter available from: http://cablesnmor.com/hard-drive-converter.html
       ISP_IO     - Atmel micro In System Programming connector (for SW upgrade)
                      pin 1    - GND
                      pin 2    - GND
                      pin 3    - ATmega161 Reset
                      pin 4    - ATmega161 SS
                      pin 5    - ATmega161 MOSI
                      pin 6    - ATmega161 MISO
                      pin 7    - ATmega161 SCK
                      pin 8    - Not Connected
       SIO_IO     - Atari SIO bus plus extensions
                      pin 1    - Data_In (SIO pin 5)
                      pin 2    - Data_Out (SIO pin 3)
                      pin 3    - Command (SIO pin 7)
                      pin 4    - Reset_Out
                      pin 5    - GND (SIO pin 4)
                      pin 6    - GND (SIO pin 4)
                      pin 7    - +5V (SIO pin 10)
                      pin 8    - Not Connected

  The Reset_Out (SIO_IO pin 4) is active (low state) when the SIO2IDE performs
  the start-up initialisation sequence and the disk D1: is On (jumper HD1_ZW).


II. DISK STRUCTURE

    The SIO2IDE interface uses disks formatted under DOS or WIN9X operating
  system. The following file systems (partition's types) are supported:

      Partition Type      ID       Description
   ----------------------------------------------------------
      Small DOS           $04      FAT16 <32MB
      Big DOS             $06      FAT16 >32MB (DOS)
      FAT16               $0E      FAT16 >32MB (Windows)
      FAT32               $0B      FAT32
      FAT32               $0C      FAT32 with LBA support
      ISO9660             $7F      CD-ROM filesystem

    ATARI disk images supported by the interface must be stored in well known
  ATR file format. There are the following limitations for the *.ATR files:

    - all ATR files must contain correct 16B header
    - all ATR files must be defragmented (use defrag.exe if needed)
    - directory with ATR files must contain configuration file (sio2ide.cfg)

  All ATR files that don't meet above criteria will not be visible by the
  SIO2IDE interface.

    The user can store ATR files in any disk location but the interface after
  power up or reset always starts from the disk root directory (c:\sio2ide.cfg).
  To change active configuration (directory) use fdisk.com software.

  For example your HDD can contain the following files:

    C:\
      |- sio2ide.cfg
      |- mdos453.atr
      |- soft001.atr
      |- ...
      |-------------\DOS\
      |                    |- defrag.exe
      |                    |- speedisk.exe
      |                    |- ...
      |-------------\UTILS\
      |                    |- chkfs.exe
      |                    |- makeatr.exe
      |                    |- ...
      |-------------\SOFT\
                           |- games003.atr
                           |-----------------\GAMES\
                           |                        |- sio2ide.cfg
                           |                        |- games001.atr
                           |                        |- games002.atr
                           |-----------------\UTIL\
                                                    |- sio2ide.cfg
                                                    |- util001.atr
                                                    |- util002.atr

  In the above configuration the user can select and set as active one of the
  following directories (sio2ide.cfg files):

      C:\sio2ide.cfg
      C:\SOFT\GAMES\sio2ide.cfg
      C:\SOFT\UTIL\sio2ide.cfg

  Note that file C:\SOFT\games003.atr will not be visible by the SIO2IDE.

  Each configuration file (sio2ide.cfg) is a text file that includes current
  ATARI disk assignment. Lines in this file have the following format:

  D<no>=<ATR file>

  where:
       <no>        - ATARI disk number (1-5)
       <ATR file>  - ATR file name without extension (capital letters)

  Note that:

     - each entry must start from the first column
     - order is not important
     - unresolved lines are ignored
     - file size is limited to 512B

  For example c:\sio2ide.cfg file can contain the following data:

>>> cut here -------------------------------------------------------------------

//             SIO2IDE v 3.1 configuration file (disks map)
//
// Syntax:   D<nr>=<name>
//           nr   - ATARI disk number (1-5)
//           name - ATR file name (without extension)
//
// Warning:  Size of this file is limited to 512B
//
D1=MDOS453
D5=SOFT001
D2=IMAGE002
// End

>>> cut here -------------------------------------------------------------------

  After power up or reset the following disk will be available for ATARI
  (refer to the above disk structure):

  D1: = MDOS453.ATR
  D2:   not available because c:\image002.atr does not exist
  D3:   not assigned
  D4:   not assigned
  D5: = SOFT001.ATR

  Note that Long File Names (LFN) are not supported by SIO2IDE. For FAT disks
  LFN files will be visible like under DOS. For ISO9660 disks LFN files will
  not be visible by SIO2IDE.


III. SIO2IDE INTERFACE (via Atari SIO)

     The physical disk drives and other peripherals are external to the ATARI
  home computers and are normally attached to the "serial interface connector"
  on the right side or back of the computer. The software in the operating
  system (OS ROMs) to access the devices attached to either connector call
  the "serial I/O driver" or SIO for short. The SIO2IDE interface is capable
  of handling two groups of SIO commands:

     - Disk Drive specific commands required by the Atari OS and DOS
     - SIO2IDE specific commands that are used by the interface configuration
       software (fdisk.com)

  III.1. Disk Drive commands

     The following minimum set of disk drive commands are supported by the
  SIO2IDE interface:

   Device  Unit   Command  Direction   Byte Ct.   Aux Bytes    Function
   $31    Drive#    $21    From Drive   128/256       0         FORMAT DISK
   $31    Drive#    $50    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(no vfy)
   $31    Drive#    $52    From Drive   128/256    1 to MaxS    READ
   $31    Drive#    $53    From Drive      4          0         READ STATUS
   $31    Drive#    $57    To Drive     128/256    1 to MaxS    WRITE(verify)
   $31    Drive#    $4E    From Drive      12      1 to MaxS    READ CFG.
   $31    Drive#    $4F    To Drive        12      1 to MaxS    WRITE CFG.

  General notes:

     The byte count is always 128 for the first three sectors (1, 2, and 3)
     of a drive. All other sectors on a disk drive are 128/256 bytes long.

     Drive# identifies the drive unit (0-6). Max 7 disk drives can be
     emulated by the SIO2IDE interface.

     MaxS is a maximum sector number that is available on the emulated disk
     drive unit (1-65535).

  FORMAT DISK ($21)

     This command is accepted by the interface but the disk drive is not physically
  formatted (this operation is not needed). The SIO2IDE always returns a fixed
  data block 128/256 bytes (filed with 0xFF). This indicates that operation was
  successfully finished.

  READ STATUS ($53)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by this command are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Indicates the sector size (fixed value 0x30 or 0x10).
                  bit 4: 1 - Motor is ON
                  bit 5: 1 - 256 bytes
     byte 1:    Inverted Error Status (fixed value 0xFF, no errors)
     byte 2:    Format Time Out (fixed value 0xE0)
     byte 3:    Fixed value 0x00

  READ/WRITE CFG. ($4E,$4F)

     The individual (fixed) bytes transferred by these commands are defined as
  follows:
     byte 0:    Tracks per side (0x01 for HDD, one "long" track)
     byte 1:    Interface version (0x10)
     byte 2:    Sectors/Track - high byte
     byte 3:    Sectors/Track - low byte
     byte 4:    Side Code (0 - single sided)
     byte 5:    Disk Type Code (0x0C or 0x80)
                  bit 2: 1 - double density (256 bytes/sector)
                  bit 3: 1 - IDE HDD
     byte 6:    High byte of Bytes/Sector (0x01 for double density)
     byte 7:    Low byte of Bytes/Sector (0x00 for double density)
     byte 8:    Translation control (0x40)
                  bit 6: Always 1 (to indicate drive present)
     bytes 9-11 Drive interface type string "IDE"

  Note that the data transferred by the Write Configuration command is not
  used by the SIO2IDE interface. Only bytes 2 and 3 (max number of sectors)
  are verified with drive parameters.

  III.2. SIO2IDE specific commands

     The following set of SIO2IDE specific commands are supported by the
  interface:

   Device  Unit  Command  Direction  Byte Ct.  Aux Bytes  Function
   $71     S2I#    $11    From Drive   15        Disk#     GET disk desc.
   $71     S2I#    $12    To Drive     15        Disk#     PUT disk desc.
   $71     S2I#    $13    From Drive   15          -       GET first ATR file from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $14    From Drive   15          -       GET next ATR file from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $15    From Drive    1        Disk#     OFF disk (returns $FF if OK)
   $71     S2I#    $16    From Drive    1          -       SAVE config file in active dir. (returns $FF if OK)
   $71     S2I#    $17    From Drive   10          -       GET HDD params.
   $71     S2I#    $18    From Drive    4          -       GET File System params.
   $71     S2I#    $19    From Drive   15          -       GET first Subdir from cur. dir.
   $71     S2I#    $1A    From Drive   15          -       GET next Subdir from cur. dir
   $71     S2I#    $1B    To Drive     15          -       CHANGE current directory
   $71     S2I#    $1C    From Drive   15          -       GET current directory
   $71     S2I#    $1D    From Drive   15          -       INITIALISE current directory

  Notes:

     S2I# identifies the SIO2IDE interface (0-1). Maximum two SIO2IDE interfaces can
     be connected to the Atari SIO Bus (jumper MS_ZW).

     Disk# identifies the ATARI disk (1-5).

     Commands $11 $12 $15 allows to read and update internal disk table serviced
     by the interface. This table holds current disks assignment.

     Commands $13 $14 allows to get descriptions of all correct ATR files that
     are available in the current directory.

     Commands $19 $1A allows to get descriptions of all subdirectories that
     are available in the current directory. To initialise current directory
     use command $1D. Note that after successfull initialisation interface
     saves current directory description to the internal EEPROM. During
     startup interface first tries to initialise last saved directory.

     Note that: Commands $13 to $16 can be used only if current directory was
     successfully initialised by command $1D.

     All disks, ATR files and directories are described by the following common
     data structure (15B long):

     Data      Bytes    Description
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------
     Name       0-7     Disk/File/Directory name, 8 chars filled with spaces
     Sector     8-11    32-bit sector number
     Sectors    12-13   Number of sectors (128B/256B), 0 for directories
     Flags      14      bit 7:  correct ATR file
                        bit 6:  256B sectors
                        bit 2:  read-only file (can be changed)
                        bit 1:  directory

     The following data structure describes IDE device parameters (10B long,
     command $17):
